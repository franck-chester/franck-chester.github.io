This looks interesting...Good article about reconciling domain driven design and REST. Quite old, but then again the DDD books I have read are as well, andcouched in very old fashion SOA language, which I haven't had much to do in recent years. Feels like both a trip down memory lane and a refresher ðŸ¤¨
