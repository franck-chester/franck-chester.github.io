title: Setting up my GitHub page with Jekyll
tags: jekyll github
---

I have decided to finally set up a [mini blog type site](/home) on my under utilised GitHub.
The main intention is to have a single place to put all the random stuff I find when browing the internet, twitter and linkedin, in a format I can then share as and when I think it could be useful to the wider world.

# GitHub Pages

I follow the [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to setup a new repository `franck-chester.github.io` on my personal GitHub [https://github.com/franck-chester](https://github.com/franck-chester).

My default branch, where I will create content and configure Jekyll, is `main`.
I create an additional `gh-pages` branch where I will publish the built up site.
I then [configure GitHub pages to source content from `gh-pages`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

Finally, I clone this blank repository to my ubuntu environment on WSL2.

# Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator, and comes [recommended when setting up GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

Setting it up in my new repository was no problem, just follow the instructions.

It [isn't officially supported on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/), but not an issue here as I have just setup Ubuntu on WSL2.
Plus running it locally on Ubuntu keeps it all much closer to the GitHub action environment that I intend to use for the day to day site generation.

# Look & Feel - So Simple

I don't really want to spend too much time styling this, so will simply use one of the many available [free Jekyll themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/free), in this case [So Simple](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) looks good enough.


## Configuring So-Simple

From the [README.ME](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/README.md) file:

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile (or create one):

```
gem "jekyll-theme-so-simple"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's _config.yml file:

```
theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple
```

Then run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:
```
bundle install
```

## Create some default content

In the root of my site, I create the following pages, using markdown, and the corresponding [So-Simple layouts](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme#layouts) in the *front-matter* :

- index.md
- posts.md
- seach.md
- tags.md

## Configuring GitHub 

We can't use GitHub Pages' built in Jekyll functionality, as it is many versions behind and limits the gems we can use.
Instead, we will use [helaili/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) to publish our GitHub pages via a GitHub action.

Again, we can simply use the documentation, making sure to target the `gh-pages` branch.

We can push our `main` branch to GitHub, which triggers the GitHub action, which results in a nicely styled
