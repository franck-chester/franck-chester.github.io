It's been a while since my last proper post, 
but I've given a presentation last week that deserves
to be expanded into a post.

The presentation was about my current employer,
 the Very Group, transformation away from its legacy systems and processes,
and the technology behind that modernisation.

My contribution to the presentation was specifically about how
the Digital Customer Experience (DCX) tribe will rearchitect
our flagship e-commerce websites away from our aging 
monolithic platforms towards a modern, composable, MACH architecture.
