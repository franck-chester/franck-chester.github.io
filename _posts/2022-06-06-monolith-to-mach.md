It's been a while since my last proper post, 
but I've given a presentation last week that, I believe,
 deserves to be expanded into a post.

The presentation was about my current employer,
 the Very Group, transformation away from its legacy systems and processes,
and the technology behind that modernisation.

My contribution to the presentation was specifically about how
the Digital Customer Experience (DCX) tribe will rearchitect
our flagship e-commerce websites away from our aging 
monolithic platforms towards a modern, composable, MACH architecture.

Here, I reproduce the slides, together with additional
thoughts I didn't have time to cover during my slot.

# The problem of the monolith

# Replacing the monolith - carefully

## Ship of Theseus
## Logically distinct customer journeys
## Logically distinct architecture layers
## Logically distinct bounded contexts
## Strangler fig pattern

# MACH target architecture

## Microservices
## APIs and Events, everything 'as a Service'
## Cloud native components and technologies
## Headless components and services

# Technologies behind our transformation

## SaaS partners 
## AWS PaaS value-added services
## DCX technology stack
