title: Setting up my GitHub page with Jeckyll
---

I have decided to finally set up a [mini blog type site](/home) on my under utilised GitHub.
The main intention is to have a single place to put all the random stuff I find when browing the internet, twitter and linkedin, in a format I can then share as and when I think it could be useful to the wider world.

# Jeckyll

[Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator, and comes [recommended when setting up GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

Setting it up was no problem, just follow the instructions.

It [isn't officially supported on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/), but not an issue here as I have just setup Ubuntu on WSL2.
Plus running it locally on Ubuntu keeps it all much closer to the GitHub action environment that I intend to use for the day to day site generation.

# Look & Feel - So Simple

I don't really want to spend too much time styling this, so will simply use one of the many available [free Jeckyll themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/free), in this case [So Simple](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) looks good enough.


``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme.git
```

From the [README.ME](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/README.md) file:

## Ruby Gem Method (when testing locally)

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile (or create one):

```
gem "jekyll-theme-so-simple"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's _config.yml file:

```
theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple
```

Then run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:
```
bundle install
```
## GitHub Pages Method (for daya to day CI/CD)

Replace `gem "jekyll"` with:

```
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

Run `bundle update` and verify that all gems install properly.

Add `remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"` to your _config.yml file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entries.
