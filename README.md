# franck-chester.github.io

This repository holds my personal blog, [franck-chester.github.io] (https://franck-chester.github.io/).

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is refreshed automatically whenever I commit new files, thanks to a simple [GitHub action](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/#setting-up-the-action).

When testing locally :

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --future
```
