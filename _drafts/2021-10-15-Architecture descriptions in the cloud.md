title: 2021-10-15-Architecture descriptions in the cloud
tags: architecture
---

This week I have started documenting our target architecture. Now, what I was actually asked to do was "document our target cloud infrastructure", but I have been there before and believe a formal (ish) overall architecture description is required before diving into any specific problem area.

What do I mean by an architecture description? I mean a comprehensive set of documents that slice and dice the architecture using [viewpoints] () and [perspectives] ().
This is something I learned to do back in the year 2000 as a bushy tailed technical architect.
At the time it was easy, and a good idea, to use the viewpoints and perspectives listed in X and Y's book "" and summarised on the website ().
However, over the years I have learned to tailor them to my specific domain 
However attempting this again this week
