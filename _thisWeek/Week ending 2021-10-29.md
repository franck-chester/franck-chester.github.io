This week was all about AWS. First, I have kinda agreed to attempt an AWS certification as part of my professional development plan.
I have long resisted the idea, in part because I have never done well with pure memory based knowledge, but also because I hate video training, which seems to be what everybody else learn through.

Instead, I have bought and started reading [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Study Guide: Associate SAA-C01 Exam 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Study-Guide/dp/111950421X).

2nd, I have got around an issue with Terraform CDK, pretty basic stuff that has still managed to plague me for a few weeks now.
I have made some real progress, used the CDK to create an IAM role and policy.
Not done the write up on this yet, but I have updated what is meant to be the first episode in the series: [2021-10-01-Scripting access to my AWS sandbox]({% post_url 2021-10-01-Scripting access to my AWS sandbox %}).
