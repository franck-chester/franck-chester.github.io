This week I made a start on our tribe's architecture description. The introduction to it felt interesting enough to share as a blog of its own.
Other than that, I made myself look like an idiot by re-discovering the solution of a git problem that was already clearly documented on our confluence pages.

Still reading and learning tons from [Release It! (2nd Edition) - Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software](https://pragprog.com/titles/mnee2/release-it-second-edition/). A lot of it will end up in the reliability perspectives of my architecture description.
