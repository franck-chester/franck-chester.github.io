Another week with nowt interesting to say. I really need to go back to doing this seriously.
Focus at work is still around AWS infrastructure, how to best build a modern AWS microservice architecture that is performant and cost effective, and secure and still support devSecOps friendly practices.

On the plus side, I am having great fun with [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
