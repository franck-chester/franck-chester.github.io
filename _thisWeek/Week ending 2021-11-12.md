This week was a lot about security and threat modelling [^1]. Haven't written anything about it but I am looking into building a AWS specific [Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool) template to support and standardise the way we perform [threat modelling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling). Might turn it into a post, later.

[^1] Modelling is spelt with 2 L in proper British English, but just one in the USA [patois](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patois)!
