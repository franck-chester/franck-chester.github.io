This week has been split between researching REST API caching best practices, and AWS ECS (elastic container services) and the differences between container and fargate tasks.

Haven't had time to write anything myself, although I've done a big piece about caching for work which I might later reformat as a post as I've gathered quite a lot of useful info.
